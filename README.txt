Orginally to start this was a very fun project along the way we encountered many issues that where easliy fixed. alot of this selfbot is quite buggy but all works relatively well.

To install this 

pip install -r requirements.txt

then python3 bot.py, install anything that isnt in the requirements shouldnt take anylonger than a couple of mins

Shoutout to sipher and cnr for the help on this project 

meh shit happens :D

The nitro sniper works to an extent... 

Slotbot and pollux sniper are completely broken

The token logger and whitelist system has been removed as per the orginal source code

Interactive commands are really weird since we wanted to support a friends api @notii 

Crypto Command is one of the biggest out there, planning on expanding

shout out @ilyrookie for the sexy backend we used :D
